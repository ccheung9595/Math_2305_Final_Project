Math_2305_Final_Project.

Doctor Randy Davila,

The purpose of this project is to write a Python program that has multi-functions
to solve a minimum tree spanning problem.  A spanning tree of a graph can be defined 
as a graph with minimum set of edges that connect all vertices. A minimum
spanning tree of a graph is a spanning tree of the graph with least weight (where
the weight is computed by adding the weights of all the edges in the spanning tree).
In general, a graph can have multiple minimum spanning trees. The task assigned is to find a minimum spanning tree of a graph.
